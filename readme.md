Welcome to my Advent of Code repository!
## Overview
Advent of Code is a yearly event where a set of programming puzzles are released for the public to solve. I have decided to complete the 2024 year's challenges using Go programming language mainly to learn it. This is my first touch with this language.

## Goals and Limitations
- I will not be attempting to complete all the days and challenges.
- My main priority is to provide working solutions that demonstrate my understanding of the concepts and techniques required to solve the puzzles.
- I will also be documenting my thought process and the reasoning behind my choices in the code comments, to help others understand how I approached the problem.

## Conclusion
Please keep in mind that these solutions are my own and might not be the most optimal or the most beautiful, but they are the best I could come up with.
